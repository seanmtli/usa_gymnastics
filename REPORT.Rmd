## Introduction

The sport of artistic gymnastics has long been a source of national pride and international recognition for the United States. The breathtaking performances, grace, and unparalleled athleticism displayed by American gymnasts have not only brought numerous Olympic medals home but also served as an inspiration for generations of aspiring athletes. As we approach the next Olympic Games in Paris 2024, the need for innovation and precision in athlete selection has never been more crucial. Our goal is to predict the best five-member lineups for both the USA Men's and Women's artistic gymnastics teams, optimizing for total medal count. Other goals include exploring optimizing lineups for weighted medal counts or for team medals vs individual medals.

Historically, this selection process has relied heavily on the expertise and intuition of coaches and selection committees. However, in the era of data-driven decision-making, the role of predictive analytics and machine learning in the world of sports has gained unprecedented significance. The study will be of upmost significance, giving insight into lineup strategies in gymnastics and helping the USA maximize their medal count potential for the 2024 Paris Olympics. 

While some prior studies have explored the use of data analytics in sports, they often fall short in the context of artistic gymnastics. Many of these studies are limited in scope and do not consider the nuanced aspects of gymnastics performance. Also, previous judging in artistic gymnastics with some apparatus being more difficult to judge. We will explore how to mathematically account for this in our analysis.

This study aims to overcome these limitations by analyzing athlete-specific data and incorporating domain expertise from the gymnastics community. It will offer a comprehensive and customized approach that addresses the unique competition format presented by artistic gymnastics and provides the USA Olympics Committee with a robust tool to make informed and data-driven decisions.


## Methodology

### A Two Tier Approach

Treating this as an optimization problem maximizing for different versions of "best", we developed nuanced heuristics based off analyzing past Olympic gymnastic event results to pick our top 5 lineups. Historically, we've seen that the USA along with most countries send a combination of all-round gymnasts and event specialists in a 5 person lineup. Specifically, the USA Olympic Team Selection Procedure outlines that the top 2 overall all-round gymnasts will qualify and then the committee will select the other 3 to complement them. We wanted to mimic this approach, leading us to choose a 2 tiered approach, first choosing the top 2 overall all-round gymnasts and then choosing the 3 to compliment the top 2 to maximize medal count. 

For the all-round gymnasts, we choose the 2 best candidates that have the highest total score average across all the events they have participated in the past. Specifically, we would aggregate the score across all the events a gymnast has participated in for a competition and then take the average of their total scores in different competitions to find a composite score.  

For the specialists, we chose the 3 specialists based on a weighted score distribution of the events for each gymnast, translating the weighted average score into a probability for medaling. We calculate a weight of an apparatus result taking into account the "stage" of an apparatus (qualifier or finals) and also the recency of the competition itself.

### Weighted Average Score Distributions

For a final round performance, we multiply the score earned by 1.5x. The reasoning behind this weighting is that we believe a heavier weight should be placed on athletes with a history of performing better under pressure in the final rounds. We then classify a performance by how recent the competition was into 3 categories: very recent (< 1 year), somewhat recent (2-3 years), not recent (3+ years). These three recencies are multiplied by 2x, 1.5x, and 1x respectively. It's important to take into account if a gymnast is at a peak performance era and simultaneously look out for younger gymnasts on the rise. We then generate each USA gymnast's distribution assuming a normal distribution of performances. This assumption is justified, as when we look at the top 10 gymnasts regardless of country across apparatus, we see they individually have a performance score distribution that is approximately normally distributed. To obtain a probability of medaling, we find a threshold of a weighted average score that it usually takes to medal on that apparatus from compiling past results. This threshold is adjusted higher or lower based on who we predict other top countries might send.
