# Vaulting into Victory: Optimizing for USA Gymnastics Medal Count at the Paris 2024 Olympics

This is a project that creates a tool to choose the best liineup for the total expected medal count in artistic gymnastics at the Paris 2024 Olympics. It is part of a submission to the UCSAS 2024 data challenge. Our goal is to use a simulation based approach to predict the best five-member lineups for both the
USA Men’s and Women’s artistic gymnastics teams, optimizing for total medal count.
